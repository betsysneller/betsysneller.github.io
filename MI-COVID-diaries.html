       <summary>About this project</summary>
       <p style="color: #636363; font-family: Raleway; font-weight:normal; font-size: .75em;"> <br> Life in Michigan has changed very quickly for many people over the past few weeks. The MI-COVID-diaries project aims to document what life is like in Michigan during the Coronavirus lockdown and afterwards, as we move back into normal life. We are interested in all aspects of how life is changing for Michiganders, from their daily routines to their language. We are looking for Michiganders who are interested in submitting periodic oral history recordings during this time. The MI-COVID-diaries project is run by the <a href="http://sociolab.wagnersu.msu.domains/">Sociolinguistics Lab</a> at <a href="https://msu.edu/">Michigan State University.</a> To hear from some of our participants this week, click "Listen to our participants" below. To hear stories from previous weeks, you can check out the <a href="MI-COVID-archive">archive.</a></p>

		    <blockquote class="align-left" style="color: #636363; font-family: Raleway; font-weight:normal; font-size: .6em;"> I am a third grade school teacher. We're in our 6th week of distance learning for our students. This is not something I was trained to do.  They are learning so much about technology and problem-solving. I mean it is, it is so cool to see an email come from a child rather than an adult asking a question about how something has to be done. 
		    <br> 
		    <br> I can sense their angst. I can sense their frustration. You know at our last grade level meeting we talked about different standards. Different standards of each subject that need to be covered yet and that we need to record on the report card. But the more I think about it is I really am not too worried about those standards. I really don't care. What's more important to me is those kids, and getting them through the trauma and the uncertainty that comes with this pandemic. So often I'll have a child say "Do I have to do this?" and it's like, no you don't. To me, it's just a blessing to see their faces on the Zoom screen each day. And to see that they're okay.
		    <br>
		    <br> And I've also found that it's good for them to talk to each other.  They don't have a way to do that right now.  They can't play with their friends. They're stuck in their house with their family and they just need to talk to their friends, you know.
		    <br> And when I'm present in Zoom, it doesn't always work so well. So what I'm starting to do now is when I'm finished with what I need to cover, I think guys let's let's break into some breakout rooms and just talk to each other.  It is the longest three minutes of my day waiting for them to come back from the break room. And I know that when I joined one of their breakup rooms, they just stop talking because I'm there and they think I need to take over. Even if I tell them I don't. But when they come back from the break out room, they're smiling so beautifully because they've just had a chance to talk to their friends.  They can't meet them on the playground. They can't meet them in a classroom, but they can meet them in a Zoom breakout room.
		    <br>
		    <br> To me the most important thing that I want my kids to remember is who they are and whose they are. I don't really care if they remember addition and subtraction and multiplication and division. I don't care if they don't know the parts of speech. When when fourth grade begins for these guys there are there are going to be pieces to pick up. But I want their brains to be able to work properly. I don't want them to be burned out.  I just want them to be able to continue on.

		      We have *intended* to try to make our own masks, to answer the last question. We even bought a sewing machine on Amazon. But since we haven't been outside -- meaning, haven't been outside in the public -- We've had less of an incentive to try to make our own masks, and other things keep coming up and we keep pushing it off. At this point in time, I've ordered a few months off masks online. One of the companies that I think I mentioned in my last diary, fanatics.com, have partnered with the NBA to make a team branded masks that they now sell. They're supposed to arrive here sometime in mid-May. And I guess remains to be seen whether or not we're going to try to do something before that in terms of making our own masks.
		      <br>
		      <br>
		      I'd like to, personally. I'd like to be able to share masks with the community, if I'm able to make them. But much like with a lot of the other good intentions that we've had in terms of, you know, me learning python or me learning to play the guitar: being productive personally productive when it's not -- when the (Big Bang Theory fans will recognize this) When the locus of -- this quote -- when the locus of motivation is not external. Sometimes it gets really hard to motivate yourself to do something productive internally. So very long-winded way of answering this question with: No, we have not yet tried to make our own masks. But we have all the materials and sewing machine that hopefully -- it's tiny, it's cheap -- but hopefully is up to the task, if and when we finally get around to it.

       <summary>FAQs</summary>
         <p style="color: #636363; font-family: Raleway; font-weight:normal; font-size: .6em;"> <br> <b>How does this work?</b>
         <br>Our research team will send you an email every week (or as often as you designate that you would like to participate) with a list of prompts to get you thinking, and a link for uploading your diary file. You can talk about these prompts, or about anything else that is on your mind. We especially want to hear stories of what your life is like - what you did during the day or the week, things that brought you joy or struggles you are having.
       <br>
       We are looking for as much of your story as you would like to tell, whether it's a 5 minute recording or an hour long recording. 
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>What do I need to use to record myself?</b>
       <br>You can use any recording software that you like - we recommend downloading and using the free software <a href="">Audacity</a> and recording yourself using a pair of earbud headphones that have a microphone, such as Apple EarPods. You can also use the built in recording program in your phone, such as Apple's Voice Memos or Sound Recorder for an Android phone. If you are using an iPhone, you will need to first save your Voice Memo ("save to file") - then you'll be able to upload it to our secure server.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Do I need to be a Michigander to participate?</b>
       <br>Right now we are only collecting stories from Michigan residents. If you are currently living in Michigan, we would love to hear from you.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>How do I submit an entry?</b>
       <br> Your email will include a link to securely upload your audio diary. Or you can upload your file directly through this website, below!
       

       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Can I submit a diary entry more often than once a week?</b>
       <br> Yes! You may use your link as often as you would like to submit a new entry. We would love to hear from you as often as you would like to participate.
