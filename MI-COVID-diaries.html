       <summary>About this project</summary>
       <p style="color: #636363; font-family: Raleway; font-weight:normal; font-size: .75em;"> <br> Life in Michigan has changed very quickly for many people over the past few weeks. The MI-COVID-diaries project aims to document what life is like in Michigan during the Coronavirus lockdown and afterwards, as we move back into normal life. We are interested in all aspects of how life is changing for Michiganders, from their daily routines to their language. We are looking for Michiganders who are interested in submitting periodic oral history recordings during this time. The MI-COVID-diaries project is run by the <a href="http://sociolab.wagnersu.msu.domains/">Sociolinguistics Lab</a> at <a href="https://msu.edu/">Michigan State University. </a></p>

       <blockquote style="color: #636363; font-family: Raleway; font-weight:normal; font-size: .6em; margin-top: -2em;"> In a way I... I'm glad that it kind of hit me gradually. But I think I was really shocked when I went to Costco and the parking lot was filled, like there was no spot to park. Like you had to wait for a car to back out to get in. And then when I pulled in and got out, there were people and all they had in their carts was toilet paper. And I I was just in shock like what is going on and then I went in the store and there was like maybe two carts available and I looked -- and this is like 15 minutes after the store opened -- and I looked to the back of the, looked to the store and the line to checkout was snaking around the store and I just dropped the cart. You know, just just "I'm out of here this is this is awful." That was that was the first time I realized this is something -- this is bad. 
		            <br>
		            <br> And then on the way home I went to Family Fare thinking, "well, little Family Fare in Zeeland's not gonna be as bad." But when I went to Family Fare, the shelves with all the paper products were completely empty. And I'm like "this looks like a third-world nation"" all the -- it was scary. So that's when I realized it was real.</blockquote>

       <blockquote style="color: #636363; font-family: Raleway; font-weight:normal; font-size: .6em; margin-top: -2em;"> You know it's nice hearing from parents (my students) that every single student just misses school and misses me and misses hanging out with kids -- their classmates. Like there isn't a student that you know out there I think that doesn't want to just get back to school. And I think that's kind of nice to hear. That's kind of nice, you know that school is it's more than just learning your ABCs and one-two-three, like it's -- it takes care of a lot of necessities you know the social-emotional piece and just a lot. And I get to talk to kids and it's fun to interact. You know a lot of them are learning how to do this independently and that's that's kind of cool you know like nine year olds are figuring it out. I think that's, that's hopeful.</blockquote>

       <summary>FAQs</summary>
         <p style="color: #636363; font-family: Raleway; font-weight:normal; font-size: .6em;"> <br> <b>How does this work?</b>
         <br>Our research team will send you an email every week (or as often as you designate that you would like to participate) with a list of prompts to get you thinking, and a link for uploading your diary file. You can talk about these prompts, or about anything else that is on your mind. We especially want to hear stories of what your life is like - what you did during the day or the week, things that brought you joy or struggles you are having.
       <br>
       We are looking for as much of your story as you would like to tell, whether it's a 5 minute recording or an hour long recording. 
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>What do I need to use to record myself?</b>
       <br>You can use any recording software that you like - we recommend downloading and using the free software <a href="">Audacity</a> and recording yourself using a pair of earbud headphones that have a microphone, such as Apple EarPods. You can also use the built in recording program in your phone, such as Apple's Voice Memos or Sound Recorder for an Android phone. If you are using an iPhone, you will need to first save your Voice Memo ("save to file") - then you'll be able to upload it to our secure server.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Do I need to be a Michigander to participate?</b>
       <br>Right now we are only collecting stories from Michigan residents. If you are currently living in Michigan, we would love to hear from you.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>How do I submit an entry?</b>
       <br> Your email will include a link to securely upload your audio diary. Or, you can upload your file directly on the website, here:
       

       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Can I submit a diary entry more often than once a week?</b>
       <br> Yes! You may use your link as often as you would like to submit a new entry. We would love to hear from you as often as you would like to participate.
