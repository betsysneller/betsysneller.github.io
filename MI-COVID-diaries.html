       <summary>About this project</summary>
       <p style="color: #636363; font-family: Raleway; font-weight:normal; font-size: .75em;"> <br> Life in Michigan has changed very quickly for many people over the past few weeks. The MI-COVID-diaries project aims to document what life is like in Michigan during the Coronavirus lockdown and afterwards, as we move back into normal life. We are interested in all aspects of how life is changing for Michiganders, from their daily routines to their language. We are looking for Michiganders who are interested in submitting periodic oral history recordings during this time. The MI-COVID-diaries project is run by the <a href="">Sociolinguistics Lab</a> at <a href="">Michigan State University. </a></p>

       <summary>FAQs</summary>
         <p style="color: #636363; font-family: Raleway; font-weight:normal; font-size: .6em;"> <br> <b>How does this work?</b>
         <br>Our research team will send you an email every week (or as often as you designate that you would like to participate) with a list of prompts, and a link for uploading your diary file. You can talk about these prompts, or about anything else that is on your mind. We especially want to hear stories of what your life is like - what you did during the day or the week, things that brought you joy or struggles you are having.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>What do I need to use to record myself?</b>
       <br>You can use any recording software that you like - we recommend downloading and using the free software <a href="">Audacity</a> and recording yourself using a pair of earbud headphones that have a microphone, such as Apple EarPods. 
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>How do I submit an entry?</b>
       <br> Your email will include a link to a website where you can securely upload your audio diary.
       <br>
       <br>
       <b>Can I submit a diary entry more often than once a week?</b>
       <br> Yes! You may use your link as often as you would like to submit a new entry. We would love to hear from you as often as you would like to participate.
